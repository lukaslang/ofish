1. Introduction

This is a MATLAB implementation of Optical Flow with Iso-Spherical Harmonics (OFISH) as described in:

L. F. Lang and O. Scherzer. Optical Flow on Evolving Sphere-Like Surfaces,
Inverse Probl. Imaging, 2017.

If you use this software in your work you must cite the abovementioned paper in any resulting publication!

3. Requirements

This software was originally written for and tested with Matlab R2012b.
It has been recently modified to run with R2015a.

Note that this software uses the TriRep class which since R2013a is marked 
as 'will be removed in a future release'. It also used flipdim, which will 
be removed at some point in the future.

See http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/release-notes.html

The following libraries are required for parts of this sofware:

export_fig: used for producing high quality figures from the results.
URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-exportfig

It requires the code of OFD (Decomposition of Optical Flow on the Sphere).
Download/check it out from https://bitbucket.org/lukaslang/ofd

4. Usage

For easier use we provide a startup script (startup.m), which sets up the 
Matlab search path. It includes required libraries and adds required 
subdirectories. Make sure to download the required packages and to set the 
library paths properly. Then simply run the startup script.

To run the test cases execute

>> runtests('./test')

The following run scripts are included:

- runofish.m (computes the optical flow on evolving sphere-like surfaces)
- runandrenderofish.m (additionally renders and saves the plots)

If you want to reproduce the experiments from the paper run

- experiments/prepare.m (creates and stores the linear system)
- experiments/runofishexperiments.m (runs the experiments)
- experiments/renderofishexperiments.m (renders and saves the plots)
